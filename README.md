# Bank_Account_Example

# The example you see here represents a 'Bank Account' created using python software. With the code included in this example, it shows step by step which stages a person involved in daily life follows when sending money to a person. In this example, there are three people who have an account and separate bank accounts belonging to these three people, and each bank account holder has certain funds belonging to them. These people can send money between each other as much as the money in their accounts and withdraw money using the daily withdrawal limits. But there is another situation that we are doing in this example. Just like in real life, if we think that a person has a second account, when sending money from this person's first account to another account, if the account limit is insufficient, his second account is activated, and the confirmation option is given that the rest of the money he wants to send will be taken from the person's second account. If this person approves this transaction, the money in his first account is combined with the money from his second account, and the money from his second account is reduced from the limit contained in the account.
